# Portfolio Python
Title : Business Decision Research Customer Churn Prediction
## Background
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict customer churn based on transaction data, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers at risk of leaving.

## Data Source
_MyStore dataset is_ [here](https://github.com/teguhmprayoga/Portfoliopython1/blob/main/data_retail.csv)

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project was to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer would churn. This involved preprocessing data, selecting relevant features, training the model, and evaluating its performance to provide actionable insights into customer retention.

## Task Explanation
_Please find [**Queries here**](https://github.com/teguhmprayoga/Portfoliopython1/blob/main/porto1_py%20(1).ipynb)_

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert timestamps to datetime format and create new features, such as the difference in years between first and last transactions.

2. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features, such as average transaction amount and transaction count, for the model.

3. **Model Training**: Split the dataset into training and test sets, train a logistic regression model on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Visualize the results with a confusion matrix heatmap.

5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to interpret model performance and gain insights into customer churn patterns.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model successfully classified customers based on their transaction history, with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall. The model's effectiveness was visualized using a confusion matrix heatmap. These insights can help businesses target retention strategies more effectively, ultimately improving customer loyalty and reducing churn rates.
